# Artalph -- Articulatory Phonetic Alphabet

Artalph is a system of phonetic **signs** that includes **symbols** functioning as didactic software and **characters**
operating as a font. Artalph signs are mainly transparent or translucent icons. They are *easily comprehensible*, yet,
due to their interrelations, are *highly precise*, which renders them useful for numerous didactic and research activities
in linguistics, anthropology, and speech pathology.
