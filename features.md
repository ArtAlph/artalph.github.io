# Description of {{ site.longtitle }}

## A novel structural principle (see&nbsp;[{{ site.title }}&nbsp;Inventory][1])

The {{ site.title }} **characters** represent *phonemes*, linguistically distinctive sounds characterised by a particular set of 
*phonological features*. Yet these signs are not chosen arbitrarily but are composed of **symbols** that represent these 
distinguishing *phonological features*. The power of each symbol lies more in its combinatory abilities and its place 
within the character than in its own iconic shape.

Thus, on the level of its symbol inventory, {{ site.title }} is a writing system based on an entirely new alphabetic principle:
*one symbol for one phonological feature*. This is a higher level of phonological abstraction in relation to other 
comparable systems; for example, the International Phonetic Alphabet ([IPA][3]) is based on the principal of *one sign 
for one sound*.

## A new type of alphabetic sign (see&nbsp;[{{ site.title }}&nbsp;Characters][2])

The main novelty of {{ site.title }} consists in a new way of sound representation, one based on the sound *articulation*. 
The {{ site.title }} composite characters are best described as stylized pictograms of the human articulatory apparatus.

Unlike existing alphabets, then, which are systems of arbitrary signs that encode the corresponding sounds 
in an impervious manner, the {{ site.title }} offers *motivated signs* that are easy to interpret and to memorise thanks 
to their *pictographic* nature.

However, the composite signs of the {{ site.title }} differ from the realistic pictures or pictograms used in phonetic 
textbooks to represent the articulation of sounds. The difference lies again in the *level of abstraction* and 
in the *combinatory ability of the inventory*: its primary symbols can be combined in such a way that all phonological 
features necessary for the description and articulation of the represented sound can be combined in *one* pictogram, 
whereas the use of conventional pictures requires several representations to describe one sound, not to mention 
the many phonetic characteristics that cannot be captured by a realistic picture.

## A novel approach to suprasegmental marks (see&nbsp;SUPRASEGMETALS&nbsp;in&nbsp;[{{ site.title }}&nbsp;Inventory][1])

To mark stress or length, {{ site.title }} does not require the addition of extra symbols. Instead, the pictographic nature 
of this new alphabet’s signs allows for the changing of a character’s form itself in a logical and visually 
recognizable way: an enlarged character marks a stressed sound, a lengthened character a long sound. Breaks between 
words can be indicated by spacing or by the vertical bars used in [IPA][3]. The characters in syllabic units, 
on the other hand, are linked with a horizontal line at the bottom to emphasize their unity.
